1. Don't give Akladians ranged weapons. Ranged weapons are for cowards. Giving
   Akladians ranged weapons will destroy the balance against other factions.
2. Wiseman-Holyman-Wonderman are supposed to be very, VERY rare. It should be
   extremely hard for players to advance Wiseman, hard enough so most players
   will decide to forget about it.
3. The numbers now are experimental and are effect of suggestions by AxalaraFlame
